<h3>Emilie Meinadier</h3>

    <p>
        A Los Angeles native, Emilie arrived in Paris in the early 1990s as a student and it was love
        at first sight.  Bright eyed and filled with determination, Emilie started building her network
        which incidentally allowed her to land her first job, working for the US editions of Harper’s
        Bazaar, Town & County & Cosmopolitan in the Hearst Magazine satellite office. Her ten years
        with Hearst took her to the most confidential corners of Paris and on fashion shoots around the
        world.

        As the media landscape evolved, several magazines found that there was no longer the need for
        a full time Paris office. Emilie took this cue to venture into solo entrepreneurship and EMC
        was born, lending ground support and expertise both around Fashion Weeks and on set.  Soon
        after she felt the need to reinvent herself and EMC was born. Emilie stayed true to her
        independent and free spirit that became the foundation of the EMC way.

        25+ years later, Emilie is a true Francophile, the original Emily in Paris. She has a passion
        for travel and is always looking to discover the next culinary, cultural or fashion find, no
        matter the destination, and always with her side kick Olivia, daughter and future fashionista.
