<h3>Press</h3>
<p class="green-line">
    EMC started in 2007 as a life-handler for all Fashion Week operations for the American press.
    Emilie Meinadier’s client list debuted with her Hearst portfolio and grew rapidly to include
    the New York Times and T Magazine, W Magazine, several Conde Nast books and New York Magazine.
    The teams knew they could rely on EMC to organize a full mastered agenda throughout the shows.
    With her distinct understanding of the demands of the American press, EMC synthesizes a unique
    palette of services centered around the European Ready to Wear and Haute Couture shows.

<h3>Influence</h3>
<p class="green-line">
    In 2015, reflecting new evolutions in the industry, the agency’s first digital client, Instagram,
    came on board. Soon after, EMC embraced the influencer phenomenon starting with the then little
    known Chriselle Lim, accompanying her for her first Couture week. The agency began to support
    influencers not just during fashion week but also throughout the year, building loyalty between
    brands and talents. A front row seat at a show became the means, not the goal. Fast forward to
    five year later Chriselle Lim is one of the biggest fashion influencers and the EMC roster included
    over thirty talents.
